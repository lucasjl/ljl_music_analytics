<br><br><b>Glossary:</b>

Acousticness: A confidence measure of whether the track is acoustic.

Danceability: Describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. 

Energy: A perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale. Perceptual features contributing to this attribute include dynamic range, perceived loudness, timbre, onset rate, and general entropy.

Instrumentalness: Predicts whether a track contains no vocals. Rap or spoken word tracks are clearly "vocal".

Key: The key the track is in. Integers map to pitches using standard Pitch Class notation.

Liveness: Detects the presence of an audience in the recording.

Loudness:The overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB). Loudness is the quality of a sound that is the primary psychological correlate of physical strength (amplitude). Values typically range between -60 and 0 db.

Mode: Mode indicates the modality (major or minor) of a track, the type of scale from which its melodic content is derived. Major is represented by 1 and minor is 0.

Popularity: Calculated by algorithm and is based, in the most part, on the total number of plays the track has had and how recent those plays are.

Speechiness: Speechiness detects the presence of spoken words in a track. 

Tempo: The overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM)

Valence: A measure describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry).
